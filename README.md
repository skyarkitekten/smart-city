# The Smart City DP/OS

## Overview
This is a working repository for envisioning and prototyping a digital platform and underlying 'operating system' that enables and fuels a smart city.

### The Operating System
At the foundation of Smart City DP/OS is the operating system. We think of operating systems as providing three core capabilities:

1. Compute
2. Storage 
3. Networking

These capabilities sit on top of a physical infrastructure that is ideally hosted on a public or private cloud.  The physical infrastructure should be completely invisible to operations engineers, abstracted away by the 'operating system'.

### The Digital Platform
The digital platform is the foundational building block upon which citizen value is created.

> We use the term 'citizen value' in place of 'business value' to capture and frame the unique differences in building platforms that use government funds to provide services for its citizens.

Inside the digital platform are the foundational capabilities and cross-cutting concerns:

1. Security 
1. Monitoring and Logging
1. Data Ingress / Egress
1. ML / AI 
1. Alerts and Notifications

We can think of the digital platform as the engine the provides citizen value via the underlying operating system.
